# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio of my first front end web developement projects, I have created it as an exercise in using bootstrap. It is also showcasing some of my favourite photos from my own collection, as a stand in for projects, that are to be linked later. 

## Deployed page 
https://sofie-ventzel.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/ 

## Usage
The page have a navbar, with links. Each link takes you to the relevant section of the page. Should you wish to go back to the top, just click on the button in the footer in the buttom right corner.
```md ![screenshot](assets/images/screenshot%20bp.PNG)```

When an image is clicked in the work section, it takes you to my github page. The idea is to add particular links later.
